  <h2 class="text-center">Milky Way</h2>
  <p class="text-center">Earthlings talk a lot about the possibility of life on other planets throughout the universe, but astrophysicists say in a new study that humans may have dozens of extraterrestrial neighbors in our own galaxy — the Milky Way.
   The new study, published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal, shed light on just how many planets in our slice of the galaxy could be home to past, current and future alien civilizations, as well as the bleak future that could be in store for us.</p>
 
  
  <p class="text-center">“There should be at least a few dozen active civilizations in our galaxy under the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent life to form on other planets, as [it did] on Earth,” said the University of Nottingham’s Christopher J. Conselice in a statement. “The idea is looking at evolution, but on a cosmic scale. We call this calculation the Astrobiological Copernican Limit.”</p>
